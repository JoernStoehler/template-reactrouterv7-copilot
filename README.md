## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development Tools

### Linting & Formatting

- Run ESLint:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Fix ESLint issues:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- Format code:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce:

- Type checking
- Linting
- Code formatting

These checks run automatically when you commit changes.

## Environment Variables

Server-side API keys and sensitive data should be stored in `.env` file:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update values in `.env` with your actual credentials

**Note**: The `.env` file is git-ignored and should NEVER be committed.

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment

This template is designed for manual deployment workflows.

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
